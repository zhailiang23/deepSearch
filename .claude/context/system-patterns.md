# System Patterns and Architecture

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. Agent-Driven Architecture
**Pattern**: Specialized AI agents handle distinct responsibilities
**Implementation**:
- `code-analyzer`: Code review, bug detection, logic tracing
- `file-analyzer`: File content summarization and analysis
- `test-runner`: Test execution with intelligent result analysis
- `parallel-worker`: Coordinated parallel task execution

**Benefits**:
- Context isolation prevents information overload
- Specialized expertise for different domains
- Parallel execution capabilities
- Consistent result formatting

### 2. Command Pattern System
**Pattern**: Executable commands defined as markdown files
**Implementation**:
- Commands in `.claude/commands/` directory
- YAML frontmatter for metadata and permissions
- Markdown content as executable instructions
- Hierarchical organization by functional area

**Structure**:
```
commands/
├── pm/           # Project management
├── context/      # Context operations
└── testing/      # Test operations
```

### 3. Configuration as Code
**Pattern**: System behavior defined through declarative files
**Implementation**:
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`: Development rules and practices
- `.claude/settings.local.json`: Tool permissions
- Agent definitions in markdown format
- Context files with structured frontmatter

### 4. Context Optimization Strategy
**Pattern**: Intelligent context preservation through summarization
**Implementation**:
- Agents return concise summaries instead of raw output
- Essential information preserved in context files
- Verbose operations shielded from main conversation
- Structured frontmatter for metadata

## Design Patterns

### 1. Mediator Pattern
**Usage**: Claude Code acts as mediator between user and specialized agents
**Benefits**:
- Centralized coordination
- Reduced coupling between agents
- Simplified communication flow

### 2. Strategy Pattern
**Usage**: Different agents represent different strategies for task execution
**Benefits**:
- Pluggable behavior
- Task-specific optimization
- Easy extension with new agents

### 3. Template Method Pattern
**Usage**: Commands follow consistent structure with variable implementations
**Benefits**:
- Consistent command interface
- Reusable command patterns
- Standardized error handling

### 4. Facade Pattern
**Usage**: Command system provides simplified interface to complex operations
**Benefits**:
- Simplified user interface
- Hidden complexity
- Consistent experience

## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. Request-Response with Summarization
```
User Request → Claude Code → Agent → [Complex Operation] → Summary → User
```

### 2. Parallel Execution Flow
```
Complex Task → parallel-worker → [Agent 1, Agent 2, Agent N] → Coordinated Results
```

### 3. Context Loading Flow
```
Session Start → /context:prime → Load Context Files → Enhanced Awareness
```

## Error Handling Patterns

### 1. Fail-Fast Pattern
**Implementation**: Critical configuration errors immediately terminate operations
**Examples**:
- Missing required tools
- Invalid permissions
- Corrupted configuration files

### 2. Graceful Degradation
**Implementation**: Optional features fail silently while core functionality continues
**Examples**:
- External service unavailability
- Optional tool missing
- Network connectivity issues

### 3. Resilience Layer
**Implementation**: User-friendly error messages with actionable solutions
**Pattern**:
```
Operation → Error Check → User-Friendly Message → Recovery Suggestion
```

## Security Patterns

### 1. Permission-Based Access Control
**Implementation**: Explicit tool permissions in `.claude/settings.local.json`
**Pattern**:
- Whitelist approach for tool access
- Granular permission specifications
- Tool-specific parameter restrictions

### 2. Sandboxed Execution
**Implementation**: Commands execute within defined permission boundaries
**Benefits**:
- Controlled system access
- Audit trail of operations
- Risk mitigation

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Git Integration Pattern
**Pattern**: Git operations managed through consistent interface
**Implementation**:
- Standardized git command usage
- Branch and commit awareness
- Status tracking and reporting

### 2. GitHub Integration Pattern
**Pattern**: GitHub operations through CLI tool
**Implementation**:
- `gh` tool for repository operations
- Issue and PR management
- Release automation

### 3. Testing Integration Pattern
**Pattern**: Framework-agnostic test execution
**Implementation**:
- Agent-mediated test execution
- Multi-framework support (pytest, npm test, etc.)
- Intelligent result analysis

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Async Agent Communication
**Pattern**: Agents operate independently and report back
**Benefits**:
- Non-blocking operations
- Parallel task execution
- Context preservation

### 2. Structured Response Format
**Pattern**: Consistent response format from agents
**Structure**:
- Status indication
- Key findings summary
- Detailed information (when needed)
- Next steps recommendations

## Extension Patterns

### 1. Plugin Agent Pattern
**Future Pattern**: New agents can be added through markdown definitions
**Structure**:
```yaml
---
agent: custom-agent
capabilities: [tool1, tool2]
specialization: "specific domain"
---
```

### 2. Command Extension Pattern
**Pattern**: New commands added through file creation
**Structure**:
```yaml
---
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Bash]
category: utility
---
```

## Anti-Patterns (Avoided)

### 1. Context Overload
**Problem**: Verbose output overwhelming conversation context
**Solution**: Agent summarization and context files

### 2. Monolithic Commands
**Problem**: Single command trying to do everything
**Solution**: Specialized agents for different concerns

### 3. Implicit Dependencies
**Problem**: Commands assuming tools or permissions
**Solution**: Explicit permission declarations

### 4. State Pollution
**Problem**: Commands leaving partial or corrupted state
**Solution**: Fail-fast with cleanup requirements

## Quality Assurance Patterns

### 1. Validation Pipeline
**Pattern**: Multi-stage validation for operations
**Stages**:
1. Preflight checks
2. Permission validation
3. Operation execution
4. Result verification
5. Cleanup confirmation

### 2. Atomic Operations
**Pattern**: Operations complete fully or not at all
**Implementation**:
- Transaction-like behavior
- Rollback capabilities where possible
- Clear success/failure indication

### 3. Idempotent Operations
**Pattern**: Safe to repeat operations
**Implementation**:
- State checking before operations
- Conditional execution based on current state
- Safe re-execution guarantees
