Currently undefined - framework is technology-focused rather than business-focused.

## Use Cases

### 1. Complex Project Development
**Scenario**: Developer working on multi-file feature implementation
**Workflow**:
1. Load project context with `/context:prime`
2. Use `code-analyzer` agent for codebase understanding
3. Implement changes with context awareness
4. Run tests via `test-runner` agent
5. Update context with `/context:update`

### 2. Code Review and Analysis
**Scenario**: Team lead reviewing complex changes
**Workflow**:
1. Use `code-analyzer` for comprehensive review
2. Parallel analysis of multiple files via `parallel-worker`
3. Intelligent summarization of findings
4. Context-aware improvement suggestions

### 3. Project Onboarding
**Scenario**: New team member joining existing project
**Workflow**:
1. Create comprehensive context with `/context:create`
2. Load context for immediate project understanding
3. Use structured commands for common tasks
4. Follow established AI collaboration patterns

### 4. Long-Running Development Sessions
**Scenario**: Multi-day feature development
**Workflow**:
1. Preserve context between sessions
